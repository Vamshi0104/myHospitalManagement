# HospitalManagement System

##### Hospital Management using JSP

This Repo is regarding my Mini project which is Hospital Management done by using HTML(Hyper Text Markup Language),CSS(Cascading Style sheets),JS(Java Script) as front end technologies and backend technologies used are JSP(Java Server Pages) and MySQL(Standard language for accessing and manipulating databases) as Database.The Main motto of this project is Digitializing Hospital in all aspects such as e-bills,e-receipts and avoid waiting time for patients who visit hospital.

This Project is Real Time CRUD(Create,Read,Update and Delete) Application developed by using Concept of DML(Data-Manipulation Language) in SQL and Sessions between Pages...

##### Basically This project comprises of Four Modules :

* Admin

* Doctor

* User(Patient)

* Reception

Initailly a Registration Page is given to user to Enroll as patient in the hospital ,thereby a Seperate User Ascess Page is given which comprises of Time of Appointment,Tablet need to be taken espically for Out-patients in hospital,this information is passed to Admin,Reception,Doctor modules.

 ##### Admin Module :

In this module Admin has right to Authenticate User and if necessary can access all other modules information(Doctor,User,Receptionist) in the Hospital.It is also responsibility of Admin to maintain data that is users(patients) especially out-patients who generally do not use Login/User Page after treatment.

##### Reception Module :

In this module,a Receptionist is allocated to every hospital inorder to manage the details(information) of Doctors and Patients(In-patients &Out-patients) who registered for treatment.Receptionist has right only to view the information but not alter the private information of either doctors or users.If any patient wants to book an appointment with doctor,they can approach to Receptionist,since Appointment page interface is also given to receptionist.

##### User Module :

In this module, the information of particular user who logged in can only be viewed(User-level Authentication right to access information).Initially in order to book an appointment with doctor every user has a page wherein some deatils(fields) are to be filled.Thus,The user can directly visit hospital at appointed time according to doctor availability.If any information is to be updated regarding the doctor arrival,Receptionist(Reception Module) receives the update and report it to the user regarding the appointment details.Thus user can visit hospital at appointed time without any problem.

##### Doctor Module :

In this module Doctor has right to view Patient(User) database irrespective to the In-Patient or Out-Patients in Hospital who enrolled.The Time of Appointment is even notified to the doctor and corresponding details regarding patient is displayed in tabular format for easy access.
